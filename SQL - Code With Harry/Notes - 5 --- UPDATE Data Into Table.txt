Update Data in Table:

when we need to update data/records in the table then we use UPDATE keyword with SET keyword. 

generally we use UPDATE keyword with WHERE clause, otherwise we mess all the data because UPDATE query update values in all over the table, 
so we need to define a specific condition from where we want to update data or values.

we can run UPDATE query without WHERE clause but if we do this then all the values of a column will changed.
So we use update query very carefully.
