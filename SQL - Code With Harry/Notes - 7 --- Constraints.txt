Constraints:

Constraints are the rules that applied to the table columns to ensure the accuracy, validity and integrity of the  table data.

	PRIMARY KEY
	AUTO_INCREMENT
	UNIQUE 
	NOT NULL
	NULL
	TIMESTAMP
	CHECK

1. NOT NULL:

NOT NULL constraint defines that a column cannot have NULL value.
if we don't want to keep any column Null then we can use NOT NULL constraint.
User must enter some data in the column, he cannot left the column empty.

2. UNIQUE:

UNIQUE constraint defines that all the values in a column are unique and different to each other.
UNIQUE constraint is used to store unique data in the column of table.
we cannot enter the same data into the column that have UNIQUE constraint.
it is used during table creation or we can add UNIQUE constraint in the column of the table that already created by using ALTER TABLE command and follow the add constraint syntax.

Example:
if we use UNIQUE constraint in "email" column then user cannot create multiple accounts with the same email or 2 user accounts cannot use the same email to create accounts, they have to use unique email id's.

Query:

CREATE TABLE users (
	name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

3. CHECK:

CHECK constraint checks the condition of the table data that user enters.
we need to define a condition in CHECK constraint.

4. PRIMARY KEY:

"PRIMARY KEY" uniquely identifies each rows/records in a table.
PRIMARY KEY is "not null" and "unique".

ADD Constraints In Table That Already Created:

we can add constraints in a table that already created by using "ADD CONSTRAINT" keyword in "ALTER TABLE" command.
