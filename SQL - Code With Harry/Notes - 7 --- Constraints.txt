Constraints:

Constraints are the rules that applied to the table columns to ensure the accuracy, validity and integrity of the 
data.

1. NOT NULL:

NOT NULL constraint defines that a column cannot have NULL value.
if we don't want to keep any column Null then we can use NOT NULL constraint.

2. UNIQUE:

UNIQUE constraint defines that all the values in a column are different to each other.
if we use UNIQUE constraint in "email" column then user cannot create multiple accounts with the same email or 
2 user accounts cannot have the same emails.

3. CHECK:

CHECK constraint checks the condition of the table data that user enters.
we need to define a condition in CHECK constraint.

ADD Constraints In Table That Already Created:

we can add constraints in a table that already created by using "ADD CONSTRAINT" keyword in "ALTER TABLE" command.
"PRIMARY KEY" uniquely identifies each rows/records in a table.

PRIMARY KEY is not null and unique.
