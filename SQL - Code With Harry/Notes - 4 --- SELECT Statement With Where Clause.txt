Querying Data In MySQL Using Select Statement :

Select Statement with WHERE Clause, Other Operators & Keywords:

The SELECT statement is used to query data from a table.
we can use SELECT statement with or without WHERE clause.
if we use WHERE clause, we need to define a specific condition, that which types of records do we want to see.
we can filter records/rows with WHERE clause.

a) Basic Syntax:

1. select all the records/columns of the table.
	SELECT * FROM users;

2. select some specific records/columns of the table.
	SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

b) Filtering Rows With WHERE:

1. Equal to:
	to select records which is equal to something or any number, then we use "=" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Male';

2. Not Equal to:
	to select records which is not equal to something or any number, then we use "!=" or "<>" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender != 'Female';	OR
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender <> 'Female';

3. Greater Than/Less Than:
	to select records which are less than or greater than any number, then we use "<" or ">" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth < '1995-01-01';
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > 10;

4. Greater Than or Equal / Less Than or Equal:
	to select records which are less than or equal to and greater than or equal to something or any number, then we use "<=" or ">=" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE id >= 5;
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE id <= 20;

5. Null:
	to select records which are null, then we "NULL" keyword.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth IS NULL;

5. Not Null:
	to select records which are not null, then we use "NOT NULL" keyword.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL;

6. Between:
	to select records from the table that defines a specfic range, then we use "BETWEEN" keyword.	OR
	to select records from the table that are placed in between something or any number then we use "BETWEEN" keyword.
	AND operator is used in BETWEEN keyword.

		SELECT * FROM users WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-12-31';

7. In:
	to select records from the table that includes values from given values in the table, then we use "in" keyword and define values under brackets "()".
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender IN ('Male', 'Other');

8. Like:
        Like defines pattern matching conditions.
        we use LIKE when we need a similar pattern in the records.

	to select records from table where name starts with "A":
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'A%'; 

	to select records from table where name ends with "a":
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%a'; 

	to select records from table where name contains letter "sh" anywhere in the name:
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%li%'; 

9. AND Operator:
        There are 2 conditions in AND operator.
        We use AND operator when both conditions must be true, otherwise it will not run.

	to select records from the table where both conditions must be true then we use "AND" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Female' AND date_of_birth > '1990-01-01';

10. OR Operator:
        There are 2 conditions in OR operator same as AND operator.
        But here either 1 condition can be true from both conditions
        if 1 condition will be true then it will run.
        1 condition must be true from both conditions in OR operator.

	to select records from the table where either 1 condition can be true from both conditions, then we use "OR" operator.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = 'Male' OR gender = 'Other';

11. Order By:
        it shows data in ascending or descending order that you specify.
        we use ASC or DESC keyword for ascending or descending order with ORDER BY command.
        WHERE clause is not necessary with ORDER BY keyword.
        But we can use ORDER BY with WHERE clause.

        to select records from the table where any record is ordered by ascending order or descending order, then we use "ORDER BY" keyword with "ASC/DESC" keyword.

	select all the records from the table where date of birth is order by ascending order:
		SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY date_of_birth ASC;

	select all the records from the table where name is order by descending order:
		SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name DESC;

12. LIMIT:
        to select records from the table with any limit, then we use "LIMIT" keyword.	

	to select top 5 records from the table:
		SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5; 

	to select records skip first 5 rows, then get next 10 from table:
		SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5; 

	to select 10 rows starting from the 6th row: 
		SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5, 10; 

	to select all the records which have timestamp in descending order with limit 10:
		SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

Quiz:

	to select 5 records from the table that have salary greater than 60000 and timestamp is in descending order.
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE salary > 60000 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

	to select all the records from the table and salary is in descending order:
		SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY salary DESC;

	to select all the records from the table that have salary is in between 50000 - 70000:
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000;
