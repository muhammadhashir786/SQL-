Datatypes & Constraints:

1. Datatypes:

datatype defines the type of the data that stored in the column of table.
we can write datatype after the column name of table.

INT		used to store/define the intergers and whole numbers.
VARCHAR(100)	used to store/defines the string characters, the no "100" defines the variable-length of string character up to maximum 100 characters
		and it stores the limit of maximum 100 variable-length of string character .
ENUM('', ...)	used to select values from a given list of values. 
		A string object with a value chosen from a list of permitted values. 
		it is like a radio button in HTML but here we can select multiple values or all the values from given values. 
		eg:	gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other')
DATE 		used to store date values. 
		eg:	date_of_birth DATE
TIMESTAMP	defines date and time, automatically set to the current timestamp when a row is created. 
BOOLEAN 	defines TRUE or FALSE values, often used for flags like is_active.
DECIMAL(10, 2)	Stores exact numeric data values, useful for financial data. 
		The first number is the total number of digits.
		The second number is the number of digits after the decimal point.

2. Constraints:

Constraints are the rules that applied to the column of the table.
constraints filter the data that is stored in the table.

AUTO_INCREMENT	Automatically generates a unique number for each row.
PRIMARY KEY 	uniquely identifies each row in the table.
		cannot be null and duplicated like a roll no of student in the class, people NIC Card no, vehicles no plate, peoples phone number, etc.
		bydefault it is null and unique itself.
NOT NULL	ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
		we cannot keep any column with empty value.
UNIQUE 		ensures that all the values in a column are different and unique.
DEFAULT		defines a default value for a column, if no value is provided.
		Examples:
		created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE

Q: Why AUTO_INCREMENT and CURRENT_TIMESTAMP contains "_" character instead of space?
Q: Why PRIMARY KEY contain space and does not contain "_"?

3. Create Table:

if we want to create a new table then we can use CREATE TABLE command.

4. Rename Table:

if we want to rename table then we can use the keyword RENAME TABLE.

5. Alter Table:

if we want to alter, change or modify the existing/created table/structure/schema, then we can use ALTER TABLE command.

Uses of Alter Table Command:

1. add new column:
	to add a new column in the table, use keyword ADD COLUMN with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.

2. delete any column: 
	to delete any column from the table, use keyword DROP COLUMN with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.

3. change/modify the datatype of any column:
	to change/modify the datatype of any column, use the keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE command and follow the syntax.

4. change/modify the variable-length of string character:
	to change/modify the variable-length of string character of any column of the table, use Keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.

5. move the position of any column:
	to move the position of any column of the table, use the keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.
	to move the position of any column after any column, use the keyword AFTER with MODIFY COLUMN along with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.
	to move the position of any column to the first, use the keyword FIRST with MODIFY COLUMN along with ALTER TABLE and follow the syntax.

6. change column name of the table
	to change/modify the name of any column, use the keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE command and follow the syntax.
