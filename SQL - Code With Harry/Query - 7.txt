2. FLOOR() 	gives floored salary
3. CEIL()		gives ceiled salary

to find the rounded, floored and ceiled salary from the users table:

Query:	SELECT salary, ROUND(salary) AS rounded, FLOOR(salary) AS floored, CEIL(salary) AS ceiled FROM users;

14. MOD: 

Mod function gives you the reminder after dividing any number to any number.

Query:	SELECT id, MOD(id, 2) AS reminder FROM users;

15. CONDITIONAL FUNCTIONS:

IF()
