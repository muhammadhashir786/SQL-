Delete Data in Table:

we can delete data from table like we update data into the table.

we need to DELETE data from the table by focus, because if we do any mistake when we delete data then it will be 
a problem.

so we delete data from table by defining a specific condition with WHERE clause. 
without any condition we don't want to delete any data from the table. 

as well as we can use different types of operators with DELETE keyword. 

Delete is similar to Update.

to delete the table/schema use the DROP keyword.

Note:

before delete any data from the table, see all the records from the table and
take the backup of all the table data before delete anything.
