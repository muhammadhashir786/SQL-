Delete/Remove Data From Table:

The DELETE statement removes rows from a table.
we can delete rows of table using DELETE statement.
we can delete data from table using DELETE statement like we update data into the table using UPDATE statement.
Delete is similar to Update.

Use WHERE Clause:

we need to DELETE data from the table by focus and carefully, because if we do any mistake when we delete data then it will be 
a problem.
so that's why we use WHERE clause with DELETE statement to delele rows with a specific condition.
without any condition we don't want to delete any data from the table otherwise it will delete all the data/rows from the table. 

Use Operators:

we can use different types of operators with DELETE statement like UPDATE statement.

Delete the Schema:

to delete the complete table/schema, use the DROP keyword.

Note:

before delete any data from the table, see all the records from the table and
take the backup of all the table data before delete anything. 

Syntax:

	DELETE FROM table_name
	WHERE define_condition;

1. Delete One Row:

to delete row with id = 3:

	DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 3;

2. Delete Multiple Rows:

to delete rows with gender is other:

	DELETE FROM users WHERE gender='Other';

3. Delete All Rows (but keep table structure):

to delete all the rows/data from the table:

	DELETE FROM table_name;
	DELETE FROM users;

4. Drop the Entire Table (use with caution):

to delete the entire table along with all the data use the keyword "DROP":

	DROP TABLE table_name;
	DROP TABLE users;

Best Practise:

There are 3 best practises before we update and delete data from the table:

1. Always use WHERE clause with UPDATE & DELETE statement and with SELECT is optional, unless you’re intentionally updating/deleting everything.

2. Consider running a SELECT statement with the same WHERE clause first, to confirm what will be affected with UPDATE & DELETE:

	SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 3;

3. Always back up important data before performing destructive operations.

Quiz:

to delete all the users whose salary less than 50000:

	DELETE FROM users WHERE salary < 50000;

to delete all the users whose salary is Null:

	DELETE FROM users WHERE salary IS NULL;
