datatype defines the datatype of the column of a table.
we can write datatype after the column name of the table.

		Examples:
		created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
		is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE

3. Create Table:

3. change the string character length of column 
	to change the string character length of any column of the table, use Keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE

4. move position of any column
	to move the position of any column of the table, use the keyword MODIFY COLUMN with ALTER TABLE
	to move the position of any column of the table after any column, use the keyword AFTER with MODIFY COLUMN along with ALTER TABLE command.
