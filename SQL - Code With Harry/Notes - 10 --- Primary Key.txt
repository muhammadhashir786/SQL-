Primary Key & AUTO INCREMENT:

PRIMARY KEY:

PRIMARY KEY is a constraint in SQL that uniquely identifies each rows in a table.
it is one of the most important concepts in database.

It is used to uniquely identifies each rows in a table.

Characteristics of PRIMARY KEY:

1. must be unique
2. cannot be null/empty
3. can be a single column or a combination of columns called "Composite Key".
4. PRIMARY KEY constraint is used with AUTO_INCREMENT constraint.
5. Each table can have only 1 PRIMARY KEY, not multiple.
	Only 1 column in a table can become a PRIMARY KEY.
	We can choose only 1 column from a table to make it PRIMARY KEY.
	Cannot be easy to drop PRIMARY KEY.

Q: Why PRIMARY KEY is used with AUTO_INCREMENT constraint?

when we take integer ID, so we use AUTO_INCREMENT along with PRIMARY KEY. 
because we want first record have id = 1, then second record have id = 2 and so on.
so we use AUTO_INCREMENT so that it automatically generates a new number for every next record.
And primary key is used to uniquely identifies each records of a table when we update, delete or do anything with records of table.

D/F B/W PRIMARY KEY & UNIQUE:

Q: How PRIMARY KEY is different from UNIQUE constraint?

PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints might seem similar since both prevent duplicate values.
But there are important differences. 

PRIMARY KEY must be unique.
UNIQUE must be unique.

PRIMARY KEY does not allow NULL values.
UNIQUE allows 1 or more NULL values.

Only 1 PRIMARY KEY constraint is allowed in a table/in any 1 column of a table.
Multiple UNIQUE constraints allowed in a table/in multiple columns of a table.

Ideally PRIMARY KEY is required in a table.
UNIQUE constraint is optional in a table.

PRIMARY KEY cannot be easily dropped. 
UNIQUE constraint can be easily dropped anytime. 

EXAMPLE OF PRIMARY KEY:

Query:

	CREATE TABLE users (
		id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
		name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
		email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
	);

in the above example:

id is the unique identifier for each row.
email must be unique but is not the primary key because it does not uniquely identifies each rows in a table.

DROP PRIMARY KEY:

Q: Can we drop/delete PRIMARY KEY constraint from a table?

A: Yes, but it is more restricted than dropping a UNIQUE constraint. 
   But this may fail if the primary key is being used anywhere like in a foreign key or auto increment column. 

We use ALTER TABLE command to delete the PRIMARY KEY from a table.

Syntax:

	ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;
 
Query:

	ALTER TABLE users DROP PRIMARY KEY;

TO DROP A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT:

Query:

	ALTER TABLE users DROP INDEX email;

Questions:

What is PRIMARY KEY?
Wy PRIMARY KEY is used in a table?
How many PRIMARY KEY is used in a table?
Do multiple PRIMARY KEYs are used in a table?

AUTO INCREMENT:

In MySQL, a PRIMARY KEY is often used with AUTO_INCREMENT constraint to automatically generate unique values for new rows.
This means that every time we insert a new row in a table, MySQL will automatically generate/assign a unique value to the id column. 

Query:

	CREATE TABLE users (
		id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
		name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
	);

CHANGE THE STARTING VALUE OF AUTO_INCREMENT CONSTRAINT:

we can change the starting value of AUTO_INCREMENT by using ALTER TABLE command.

Syntax: 

	ALTER TABLE table_name AUTO_INCREMENT = set_starting_value;

Query:

	ALTER TABLE users AUTO_INCREMENT = 1000;

Summary:

Use PRIMARY KEY constraint for the main unique identifier of each row.
Use UNIQUE constraint for enforcing non-duplicate values in other columns (like email or phone).
You can have only one primary key constraint, but you can have many unique constraints in a table.
